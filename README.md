# Spiders

The goal of this project is to provides web spiders for websites where I'm
reading stuff, with a unified CLI interface (and maybe a GUI, if I'm motivated
enough) to batch download for offline reading.

It's composed of the following sub-projects:

- [hyraigne](hyraigne): the library that provides the web spiders
- [bibe](bibe): a command-line tool, built on top of hyraigne, that allows you
  to download chapters locally.
